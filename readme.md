Counter with steps.

Put the number you want to start with in "In√≠cio", then the number you want to finish in "Fim". Then put on "Passo" how many steps you want the counter to skip.

E.g.: Start = 1, End = 10, Passo = 2.
Result: 1 3 5 7 9 finish

Supports both upcounting and countdown, with negative numbers. Also has emojis for showcasing!
